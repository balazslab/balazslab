<div style="text-align: justify">
<p> Tao Zhang is a soft-matter/biophysics theorist in Dr. Anna Balazs group. He is currently working on designing novel nanomaterials, such as mechano-mutable system: torsion induced controllable reconfiguration of polymer-grafted nanoparticle (PGN) networks; bioinspired nanocomposites: PGN networks encompassing the biomimetic catch bonds. He is also interested in 4D printing and soft robotics: the coupling of thermo-responsive gels and synthetic fibers allows the materials to change shape with the application of heat. </p>
